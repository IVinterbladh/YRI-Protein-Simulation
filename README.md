This project is made for the "Young Researchers' Symposium Life Science" the 24-25 of February, 2025.

### How to use the notebooks:

Option 1:
Launch Binder and perform all simulations and calculations in an environment online.
 - Click on the `launch binder` button above
 - A new tab will open binder, which will start to load the notebook
 - Once done you are ready to simulate!


Option 2:
Install all dependencies in a `conda` environment and run the simulations localy on your computer
 - Install an `Anaconda/Conda/Miniconda` or similar on your computer.
 - Open your terminal and write:
   ``` bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
    This creates an environment with all packages needed for running the notebooks
- Activate new environment:
  ```bash
  conda activate Protein-sim
  ```
- Now you can open the notebooks with either `Jupyter Notebook` or `Jupyter Lab`
